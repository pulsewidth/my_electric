## My Electric Episode 169 Playlist - a Harold Budd retrospective

"I'm somebody who plays the piano... Sometimes."

“The word ‘ambient’ doesn’t ring a bell with me. It’s meant to mean something but is, in fact, meaningless."

"It’s not relevant for me. My style is the only thing I can do well. I don’t think about genres."

"I don’t think about labels, they don’t have meanings.”

"I will tell you at the time to use the word ‘pretty music’ was kind of a political statement. It was against the received wisdom of what avant-garde music was at the time, which was confrontational. I was just trying to make it as devastatingly pretty as I possibly could."

                                               Harold Budd (1936-2020)
